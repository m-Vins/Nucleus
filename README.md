## Project Description

The Nucleos project for the Forensics course aims to enhance and revitalize an existing tool called Nucleus, available at [https://bitbucket.org/vusec/nucleus/src/master/](https://bitbucket.org/vusec/nucleus/src/master/). Nucleus is primarily designed to locate function headers in stripped binaries, aiding in the analysis of binary files. However, due to changes in library APIs, the tool was no longer functioning as intended.

The outperformed tasks can be categorized into the following areas of improvement:

1. [**Reorganization of the directory tree**](#reorganization-of-the-directory-tree):
   The initial task involves cloning the Nucleus repository and enhance the directory structure with respect to the basic version proposed [initially](https://bitbucket.org/vusec/nucleus/src/master/) which is pretty basic. This improves code maintainability, readability, and collaboration.
   <!-- TODO migliorare qui -->

2. [**Fixing the Tool**](#fixing-the-tool):
   Addressing the issues that prevent it from functioning correctly. By understanding the changes in library APIs and making the necessary modifications to the codebase in order to restore the tool's functionality.

3. [**Raw files support**](#raw-files-support):
   The tool currently focuses on Portable Executable (PE) and Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) binaries. However, there is still room for improvement in supporting raw binary files.

4. [**Evaluating different architectures performance**](#evaluating-different-architectures-performance):
   While Nucleos has undergone extensive testing for x86 architecture, the effectiveness of its approach on other architectures remains uncertain. For this task, a large number of binaries (~3000) belonging to different architectures along with their ground truth have been exploited to evaluate the performance of the tool. An other ground truth has been built using the `readelf` tool to carry out further testing.

5. [**Raw files support evaluation**](#raw-files-support-evaluation):
   This last task aims to evaluate the performance of nucleus on raw files exploiting a ground truth generated by us from the test binaries.

### Reorganization of the directory tree

- [src](./src/): This directory contains the source code files of the project.
- [include](./include): Header files reside in this directory.
- [obj](./obj): This directory is used to store object files generated during the compilation process.
- [test](./test): It contains all the files used for testing (binaries, ground_truth, ...), for further information refer [here](./test/README.md).
- [utilities](./utilities/): It contains a set of scripts used for different purposes, for further information refer [here](./utilities/README.md).

### Fixing the tool

The [source code](https://bitbucket.org/vusec/nucleus/src/master/) was broken due to changes in the API of the library `Binary File Descriptor`.

#### Issue 1

The function `bfd_octets_per_byte` is now different and it need to know the section of the binary whose we want to retrieve the number of octets per byte, thus we wrote a function to retrieve the section given the virtual memory address:

```c
asection *get_section_by_vma(const bfd *bfd_h, const uint64_t vma)
{
  for (asection *bfd_sec = bfd_h->sections; bfd_sec->next != bfd_h->section_last->next; bfd_sec = bfd_sec->next)
  {
    if (bfd_sec->vma <= vma && bfd_sec->vma + bfd_sec->size > vma)
      return bfd_sec;
  }

  // section not found!
  return nullptr;
}
```

then to fix the issue:

```diff
- bfd_vma data_offset = bfd_reloc->address * bfd_octets_per_byte(bfd_h);
+asection *bfd_sec = get_section_by_vma(bfd_h, sec.vma);
+if (bfd_sec == NULL)
+{
+   print_err("failed to get section from vma");
+   goto fail;
+}
+bfd_vma data_offset = bfd_reloc->address * bfd_octets_per_byte(bfd_h, bfd_sec);
+bfd_byte *data = sec.bytes + (data_offset - sec.vma);
```

#### Issue 2

In [loader.cc](./src/loader.cc) function `load_sections_bfd` doesn't need the first parameter:

```diff
- bfd_flags = bfd_get_section_flags(bfd_h, bfd_sec);
+ bfd_flags = bfd_section_flags(bfd_sec);
```

#### Issue 3

In [loader.cc](./src/loader.cc) function `load_sections_bfd` the following functions don't need the first parameter:

```diff
- vma = bfd_section_vma(bfd_h, bfd_sec);
- size = bfd_section_size(bfd_h, bfd_sec);
- secname = bfd_section_name(bfd_h, bfd_sec);
+ vma = bfd_section_vma(bfd_sec);
+ size = bfd_section_size(bfd_sec);
+ secname = bfd_section_name(bfd_sec);
```

### Raw files support

The support for raw file was already present in `nucleus`, even though it uses a very simple approach, disassembling from the start of the file (or at a given offset chosen by the user).
Our goal was to try to improve this technique to make `nucleus` able to find the best offset to start disassembling the file.

The very first thing we have done was trying to understand how the tool works, especially focusing on the disassembling phase. To do so, we've instrumented the program in order to log information to see the flow of the program using the format `[DBG..] <message>` so that grepping on `DBG` shows us only the info that we need.
In order to enable the logging it's just needed to set `DBG` to `1` in [disasm-x86.cc](./src/disasm-x86.cc) and in [disasm.cc](/src/disasm.cc).

To begin with, we realized that the goal of the disassembler is to identify and separate basic blocks, which will then be used to build the control flow of the program. For this reason, the disassembler will stop only in two cases:

1. When it meets a control flow instruction (jump, cmp, test...)
2. When it meets an invalid instruction

In particular, we focused on the second case, since we were interested in analyzing the behavior of `nucleus` when the disassembler breaks. We discovered that, as soon as the tool finds an invalid instruction, it stops the basic block it was building and marks it as valid. Then, it treats the invalid instruction as a stand-alone basic block, and it flags it as invalid.

Overall, the tool always scans the full file, even when meeting invalid instructions. This implies that it is using the provided offset as "ground truth", assuming that every instruction that does not exist is simply data (or garbage).

Since the option to start disassembling at a given offset was already present, we tried to see if changing the offset enhances `nucleus` performance. Using the [script test_offset.py](./utilities/test_offset.py) we collected the number of offsets that successfully find each function.
The script showed us that changing the offset does not affect significantly results, as almost all functions are found at every offset. These results suggest that the disassembling process realigns very fast.

Nevertheless, we added the option `-o` in `nucleus` in order to automatically disassemble at different offsets and collect information about the number of offsets that find each function. Overall, we embedded the logic in the aforementioned Python script directly in `nucleus`. (See [here](#commands-and-options))

### Evaluating different architectures performance

To evaluate the performance of nucleus over different architectures, a database of binaries present at [https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/binary_function_similarity](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/binary_function_similarity) has been exploited.
We've tried to embed the [script](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/binary_function_similarity/blob/main/gdrive_download.py) to download the binaries in our project to easily populate our [binaries folder](./test/binaries/) by running the command `make download_all`.
A subset of the database has been used to execute the test. The list of the used binaries is present [here](./test/binaries_list.txt), it is basically the list of the binaries belonging to the training subset used in [this project](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/binary_function_similarity). A ground truth has been extracted from the information present in the same project using the [script](./test/scripts/extract_ground_truth.sh) on the file `binary_function_similarity/DBs/Dataset-1/training_Dataset-1.csv`, we haven't made it easily reproducible since we've run this script only once, and the extracted ground truth is available [here](./test/ground_truth/).
The extracted ground truth is basically a collection of files grouped by different architectures that contains the pairs (`function name`, `start address`).

<!-- TODO write something about the ground truth extracted using readelf -->

At this point, we have all the information we need to test nucleus using the binaries and the relative ground truth. The script [test.sh](./utilities/test.sh) compares the result of `nucleus` and the ground truth, it counts:

- the number of functions found by nucleus that are present in the ground truth
- the number of functions present in the ground truth but not found by nucleus
- the number of functions found by nucleus that are not present in the ground truth

these information are then stored by the script in the file [results.csv](./test/results.csv) with the following format:

| arch  | binary                       | tested | found_count | not_found_count | false_positives |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| arm32 | arm32-clang-3.5-O0_afalg.so  | yes    | 0           | 1               | 41              |
| arm32 | arm32-clang-3.5-O0_curl      | yes    | 121         | 1               | 1057            |
| arm32 | arm32-clang-3.5-O0_dasync.so | yes    | 2           | 0               | 27              |
| ...   | ...                          | ...    | ...         | ...             | ...             |

the script can be execute by typing `make test`.

<!-- TODO conclusion about the results -->

### Raw files support evaluation

In order to evaluate nucleus on raw files, we've built a database of raw files with the relative ground truth, starting from the binaries presents in [test/binaries](./test/binaries/). We can summarize the process in the following steps:

1. [Generating one raw file from an elf](#generating-one-raw-file-from-an-elf)
2. [Generating a database of raw files](#generating-a-database-of-raw-files)
3. [Test nucleus against the ground truth](#test-nucleus-against-the-ground-truth)

#### Generating one raw file from an elf

The script [generate_raw_file.py](./utilities/generate_raw_file.py) generate a raw file starting from an elf. It basically extract the code section from the elf file, and write it in a new file at a given offset chosen by the user. The initial section of the new file that doesn't contain the code section is filled with random data. During the execution of the script, it prints the offset of the code section in the initial elf file (we'll se why).

usage:

```sh
python3 extract_code_section.py <elf_file_path> <output_file_path> <offset>

```

#### Generating a database of raw files

The script [generate_raw_dataset.sh](./utilities/generate_raw_dataset.sh) generate a database of raw files in [test/raw_files](./test/raw_files/).
It uses [generate_raw_file.py](./utilities/generate_raw_file.py) on each binary in [test/binary](./test/binaries/) to generate raw files, where the offset for the code_section in the raw file is chosen randomly. Along this process, it writes in [raw_files_offsets.csv](./test/raw_files_offsets.csv) the offset of the code section in the original elfs (using the output of the python script) and in the new raw files:

| binary                            | section_offset_raw | section_offset_elf |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| arm32-clang-3.5-O0_afalg.so       | 595                | 8192               |
| arm32-clang-3.5-O0_curl           | 742                | 245760             |
| arm32-clang-3.5-O0_dasync.so      | 99                 | 8192               |
| arm32-clang-3.5-O0_fips.so        | 389                | 45056              |
| arm32-clang-3.5-O0_libcrypto.so.3 | 262                | 655360             |
| ...                               | ...                | ...                |

The command `make generate_raw_files` run the script.

#### Test nucleus against the ground truth

The information saved in [raw_files_offsets.csv](./test/raw_files_offsets.csv) are used to test nucleus on raw files in the raw database just generated.
The [ground truth](./test/ground_truth/) contains the start address of each function in the original elf. In the newly generated raw files, the code section is not at the same offset as the original elf file. For this reason, in the script for the [test](./utilities/test_raw.sh) we convert the output of nucleus (that contains the start address of the function in the raw file) by doing `func_addr_elf = func_addr_raw - offset_cs_raw + offset_cs_elf`, and we compare it against the ground truth.

## Nucleus Usage

### Container Build

In order to avoid wasting time with various dependencies, it's possible to build a docker container using the [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).

- to build : `docker build -t nucleus .`
- to run: `docker run -it -v .:/nucleus nucleus`

Please note that this repository contains only a subset(~100) of all the binaries(~3000) that we've used to run the tests, then same for the container.
If you want to reproduce the test on all the binaries, just run `make download_all`, and then `make test`. Be aware that this operation is **very time and memory consuming**.

```

The `-o <n_offset>` option has been added by us for the implementation of the [raw files support](#raw-files-support), it makes nucleus executing the whole analysis `n_offset` times, each time starting from the next offset. The first offset can be chosen using the option `-b <vma>`. Over each iteration, nucleus count the number of offsets that find each function. Afterwards, a score is assigned to the functions found over all the iterations using the following equation : `score = N_offsets?function/N_offsets ` where _N_offsets_function_ is the number of offsets that find the functions. In this way, it is easier to spot functions that has been found only when the disassembler doesn't realign.
